- **2026-10-21** — Added docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, registry (data/registry.json, docs/REGISTRY.md) and Figma page Components · Platform Ownership. Palette cleanup paused until the Apps team explains the iOS/Android color differences (MISSING-ASSETS 3.3). "Rounding twins" renamed "near-identical hexes".
- **2026-10-21** — Checked brand colors against the migration sheet. Found the iOS drift pattern (2-decimal channels). PLAT-02 approved by rule. Started docs/DISCREPANCIES.md. Figma Color page section 06 added. Claude now pushes all commits.
