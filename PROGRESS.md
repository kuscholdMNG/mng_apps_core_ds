| Design tokens | ✅ v1 | DEC-04: tokens/ (DTCG) → Style Dictionary → Swift (iOS repo), Kotlin + 77 flavor XML (Android repo); hex + RGB in docs/BRAND-COLORS.md | (Figma Color page **06 · Brand color source of truth**; MISSING-ASSETS 3.3) |
| Discrepancy tracker | ✅ | docs/DISCREPANCIES.md: DSC-01…31 |
| Architecture | ✅ | docs/ARCHITECTURE.md: registry, variables, wayfinding, rollout |

| Components + layout: who owns what | ⏸ | New Figma page **Components · Platform Ownership**: 9 Core, 13 Core + variant, 2 iOS only, 2 Android only |
| Type comparison | ⬜ | |
| Pilot: button system end-to-end in all three files | 🔄 ⏸ review | DEC-07. Tokens, docs/components/BUTTON.md, Swift + Android View code generated/written; Core Figma page **Components · Button** (01–04) + Button variable collection; iOS and Android files: page Components · Button with Button/Primary (instances of Core Button + platform overrides) and Button/Text link |

## Phase 2 — Core atoms  ⬜
## Phase 3 — iOS file & iOS atoms  ⬜
## Phase 4 — Molecules / organisms  ⬜
## Phase 5 — QA & publish  ⬜
## Phase 6 — Move platform-only items into the iOS and Android files  ⬜

## Next session (handoff 2026-10-26)

1. **Push.** This session could not push (repos not attached to the cloud session; the device shell has no GitHub login). All three repos have local commits from 2026-10-26: Karl pushes, or start the session with the three repos attached.
2. **Karl to review the button pilot** (DEC-07): Core Figma page Components · Button, docs/components/BUTTON.md, IMPROVEMENTS CLR-04 (REQUIRED), BTN-01, BTN-02.
3. **Platform Figma files done** (libraries published and enabled 2026-10-26): iOS and Android each have page Components · Button. iOS text link color is a separate collection, Text link · iOS (20 modes matching Brand theme): set the same market in both. Tip: library imports and font loads hang when a file's tab is in the background; bring the file to the front.
4. **Ask the Apps team** (MISSING-ASSETS 5.5): iOS button height (pilot uses 44), Android label weight/size, iOS link font, pressed states. Code is not compiled yet (no Xcode or Android SDK here).
5. **Still waiting from 2026-10-21:** DEC-03 confirmation (MISSING-ASSETS 3.3), DSC-19 Android banner text, Kotlin package name, clusters for TBAN, TBE, TB, TBCP, TBHS, TCHW, TDPS. DSC-15/19 still ASAP.
6. **Next work after the pilot:** type, spacing and radius tokens; then the remaining components.
