# Discrepancies — iOS vs Android things that should match

Everything that differs between the two apps but **should be the same**. Each row says what the right value is, how we know, and which app needs the fix, so the Apps team can work through it later. Differences that are intentional platform conventions (SF Symbols vs Material, 44 pt vs 48 dp) are not listed here; they live in the registry as "Core + variant".

## 🔴 Fix ASAP

| ID | Why | Fix on |
|----|-----|--------|
| **DSC-15** | Breaking-news banner fails WCAG AA on iOS: white on `#ff0000` = 4.0:1 in 71 markets. Core value `#cf000e` = 5.74:1 (DEC-05). | iOS (all 77 markets) |
| **DSC-19** | iOS TIVDB banner text is black on red (3.66:1 on `#cf000e`, fails AA). Use white. | iOS |

## How we decide the right value

1. **Migration sheet wins.** If the sheet's Primary / Secondary color matches either app, that is the source of truth.
2. **iOS 2-decimal drift.** TroncKit stores each color channel as a 2-decimal fraction, so `0x22` (0.133) becomes 0.13 and comes back as `0x21`. When iOS = Android after that rounding, Android holds the authored value. This explains 32 of the 34 pairs the sheet could check.
3. **Web alignment (DEC-02).** Where the Cluster Audit web color is close (ΔE < 0.05) to our value, the web color becomes the value. Far → keep the earlier choice. See `docs/DECISIONS.md`.
4. **iOS default (DEC-03).** Anything still different takes the iOS value; Android gets the fix.

All brand colors are now decided; the values are in `docs/BRAND-COLORS.md` (hex and RGB) and `tokens/core/brand.tokens.json`.

## Brand colors

| ID | What differs | Should be | Fix on | Evidence | Status |
|----|--------------|-----------|--------|----------|--------|
| DSC-01 | iOS brand color off by 1 in a channel (2-decimal drift) in 36 markets: SGVT, SIT, TB, TBCP, TCCDR, TCHW, TCV, TDC, TDPS, TEBT, TETS, TFMT, TGT, TJA, TLADN, TLS, TLTC, TMCH, TMD, TMJ, TMS, TNH, TOD, TPM, TR, TRH, TROT, TRR, TSCS, TSEB, TSS, TTH, TTT, TVR, TVTH, TWDD | Android / sheet hex (e.g. `#ab4022`, not `#ab4021`) | iOS | Sheet matches Android in all sheet-covered markets; the rest follow the drift rule. TWDD is 1 unit off without fitting the rule; sheet confirms Android. Invisible on screen. Fix: store hex strings instead of 2-decimal floats. Where DEC-02 moved a brand to its web color, the target is now that color (DSC-18). | KNOWN |
| DSC-02 | **TLR** Loveland: iOS uses red `#ab4021` | `#4e5dca` | iOS | Sheet = Android. iOS value is TLS Lowell Sun's red (the next market alphabetically). | KNOWN |
| DSC-03 | **TUDJ** Ukiah: iOS uses `#408fcc` | `#32408f` | iOS | Sheet = Android. iOS value is TVR Vacaville's blue (the next market alphabetically). | KNOWN |
| DSC-04 | **TBE** Broomfield: iOS uses `#0070b8` | `#4351af` | iOS | Sheet = Android. | KNOWN |

| DSC-06 | **TSAR** Saratogian: iOS bar `#ffffff`, button and selected tab template blue `#004e87` | Bar `#f5f5f5`, secondary `#00919e` | iOS | Sheet = Android (sheet note: secondary matches the logo). Button color (`action`) still to confirm. | KNOWN |
| DSC-07 | **MC** Morning Call: Android button `#4fa8d1` | `#539cc4` | Android | Sheet = iOS. Android value is HC Hartford's blue. Selected-tab color still OPEN. | KNOWN |
| DSC-08 | **SIT** Sonoma Index-Tribune: selected tab Android `#149ce5`, iOS `#ffeb00` | `#ffea00` | both | Sheet secondary `#ffea00`; iOS is it with drift. | KNOWN |
| DSC-09 | Template blue on iOS: TBAN, TDB, TDF, TSPPP, TT show `#004e87` where Android shows each market's own color | iOS value (DEC-03) | Android | Not in the migration sheet; web color far from both apps. (TBH, TCE, TMI, TLBPT, TRDF were settled by DEC-02, see DSC-18.) | KNOWN |
| DSC-10 | SCNG group: bar settled to web `#b93611` for PSN, TPE, TSBS, TWDN (DSC-18). Still open: SGVT button (iOS orange `#ff6900` vs Android `#b11e35`) and the selected tab in all five (iOS orange vs Android black) | iOS value (DEC-03) | Android | Web color only covers the bar. | KNOWN |

| DSC-12 | Selected tab only: DP `#005f7e` vs `#4fa8d1`; TIVDB `#000000` vs `#807c7c`; TMN `#000000` vs `#6bd1e6`; OS `#15919d` vs `#00919e`; MC `#539cc4` vs `#4fa8d1`; TBH, TLBPT, TRDF (iOS black or `#9dd1f5` vs Android light blues) | iOS value (DEC-03) | Android | No secondary color in either sheet. | KNOWN |

| DSC-13 | **TPD** Press Democrat: sheet says `#9e0b0f` / `#ffea00`; both apps use black bar and gray `#999999` | iOS value (DEC-03) | Android | Sheet row is marked WIP; only the iOS section header uses `#9e0b0f`. | KNOWN |
| DSC-14 | Legacy markets OS, SS, NYDN: the sheet's Primary (`#004e87`, `#000000`, `#ec2127`) appears in neither app | iOS value (DEC-03) | Android | Sheet column may mean something else for the legacy template. | KNOWN |
| DSC-15 | **🔴 ASAP · contrast.** Breaking-news red: iOS `#ff0000` (71) / `#d80000` (6), Android `#cf000e`. White on `#ff0000` = 4.0:1, fails WCAG AA | `#cf000e` (rgb 207, 0, 14) with white text, 5.74:1 AA (DEC-05) | iOS | Android already ships `#cf000e`. | KNOWN · PRIORITY |

- **2026-10-21** — DEC-02 applied: 27 brand colors moved to the Cluster Audit web color (DSC-18). 28 brands still have an open color (16 bar/button, 12 selected tab only).

- **2026-10-21** — Started. Brand colors checked against the migration sheet: 47 of 77 markets fully resolved, 30 have at least one open role.
